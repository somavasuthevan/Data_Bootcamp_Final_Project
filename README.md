Project Description:
Happiness seems to be a common and central human desire. In life, we often make decisions to maximize our present and future happiness. Although the drive to be happy appears to be universal, the experience of happiness is inherently subjective. What makes you happy? Your answer might be very different from mine or perhaps our answers might be more similar than we expect. In this project, we explore how one's environment can shape their experience of happiness. We analyzed reported levels of happiness and factors such as GDP per capita, pollution, crime and education across 156 countries to identify patterns that might help us better understand what makes us happy and why a group people living in one part of the world might be happier than a group living in another.
